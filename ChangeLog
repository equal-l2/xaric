2001-Feb-17	Rex Feany	<laeos@laeos.net>
	* Fixed compile warnings in screen.c
	* Removed attempting_to_connect that was not
	  used anywhere.
	* Released 0.11.3

2001-Feb-15	Rex Feany	<laeos@laeos.net>
	* Fix compile problem on FreeBSD
	* Removed inet_aton replacement, wasn't 
	  used anywhere.

2000-Dec-27	Rex Feany	<laeos@laeos.net>
	* Applied patch from Chuck V. (mullein), 
	  added missing assert.h includes in misc.c/output.c
	* Bumped version to 0.11.3
	* Replaced term.c with ircterm.c, cleaned up, 
	  reindented, renamed global variables. 
	  This required several changes in other source files,
	  mostly changing CO to term_cols.

2000-Dec-17	Rex Feany	<laeos@laeos.net>
	* Don't link with librep yet.
	* Cleanup in irc.c. New command line parser.
	* Released 0.11.2

2000-Dec-5 	Rex Feany	<laeos@laeos.net>

	* Added lister.[ch]. Format and display arrays
	  of things in a smart way. We calculate
	  widths and display as many as we can on a page.
	  Used sofar by the scandir stuff. Would be nice
	  if it could page through data (if the user
	  wanted).
	* Added xscandir.c wrapper over scandir, we 
	  print list of matching files if there is more
	  then one. This is used by the help system.
	  This also needed a few new formats to be added.
	* Many cleanups in irc.c. Format fixes, removal of
	  cruft. Usage has been changed but command line
	  parser hasn't been redone yet.
	* Rewrote cmd_help.c, now it behaves like
	  the ircII help system (wow, full circle).
	  The next step is.. help files!
	* Replaced use_flow_control global with
	  set_flow_control() in term.c

2000-Nov-24 	Rex Feany	<laeos@laeos.net>

	* configure now checks for librep, a lisp interpreter
	  library. 
	* Pulled out signal handlers from irc.c and moved
	  them into signals.c. Also moved ircsig.c into
	  signals.c. Also added bits of code to call
	  the librep signal handlers when needed.
	* Removed a bit of dead code from irc.c

2000-Nov-13 	Rex Feany	<laeos@laeos.net>
	
	* Fix compile warnings

2000-Nov-13 	Rex Feany	<laeos@laeos.net>

	* Incremented version to 0.11.2
	* Added warrenty and copying files to help/
	* Integrated alias.c into expr.c. alias.c
	  was #include'ing expr.c. This included
	  creating an expr.h and getting rid of alias.h.

2000-Nov-12 	Rex Feany	<laeos@laeos.net>

	* Released Xaric 0.11.1

2000-Nov-11 	Rex Feany	<laeos@laeos.net>

	* Removed some autoreply code, check_auto_reply
	  and all of the *_AR formats.
	* Replaced the irc_lib stuff with a compile time
	  constant. Now --prefix should work compleatly.
	* Removed internal_version, not needed.

2000-Nov-8 	Rex Feany	<laeos@laeos.net>

	* Fix the Makefiles. make install now works.
	* Changed the color of the *** thing to the normal 
	  color.
	* Increased the size of the lastlog buffer tenfold
	* Fix in the terminal code so it compiles on some 
	  machines.
	* Incremented the version number to 0.11.1

2000-Nov-4 	Rex Feany	<laeos@laeos.net>

	* Released Xaric 0.11.0

2000-Nov-3 	Rex Feany	<laeos@laeos.net>

	* Modification to screen.c to update status
	  when we add things to a window. This seems
	  to give us more consistant status messages.

	* Some IRC servers do not add a leading space 
	  to the name reply (numeric 353). This breaks
	  funny_namereply which expects the space.
	  I removed the check for the ending space, 
	  and everything seems to work. 

	* Fixed invite message that referenced Ctrl-K. 
	  This is wrong. Ctrl-K is clear-to-eol!

	* Reworked the add-to-screen logic. Now things
	  bound to windows have a higher precidence then
	  window levels. When you /window level msgs
	  but have a query in another window, what you
	  would expect to happen happens (the
	  query messages go to the query window, not
	  the win level msgs window).

2000-Oct-22 	Rex Feany	<laeos@laeos.net>

	* Removed all of the old "debug" code, the context
	  macro, the x_debug global variable, and the DEBUG_VAR
	  variable. Replaced with a single system, in debug.c.

	* Removed the old cmd_hostname.c which ran external
	  programs to get hostnames. Replace with iflist.c
	  which does it the "correct" way by asking the kernel.
	  Works on a few more machines then the old way.

	* Removed files.[ch] -- not used anywhere!

2000-Oct-13 	Rex Feany	<laeos@laeos.net>
	* Create vars_gen.h using sed, just like
	  fset_gen.h.

2000-Oct-09 	Rex Feany	<laeos@laeos.net>

	* Fixed a silly bug in the dcc code that prevented
	  actions from pirc/mirc clients from being
	  interpreted as actions.

2000-Oct-08 	Rex Feany	<laeos@laeos.net>

	* Reworked fset.c, added the ability to reset
	  formats to compiled-in defaults. 
	* /save now knows how to save formats.


2000-Oct-08 	Rex Feany	<laeos@laeos.net>

	* Fixed random compile warnings.
	* Removed three_stars[].
	  line_thing is now run through convert_output_format when it
	  is set.
	* Changed the startup message to have the all-important copyright
	  information.

2000-Oct-08 	Rex Feany	<laeos@laeos.net>

	* New ChangeLog header format
	* Changed default server to be ircd.grateful.org.
	* New build system!
	  No more automake. No recursive makefiles.
	* New version tracking. Version numbers are now
	  of the form 0.9.6, and are handled by the
	  shtool version script.
	* Bumped version number to 0.11.0
	  The 0.10.x's were a private development mistake^H^H^H^Hbranch.

	* added /htm
	

Wed Oct 20 14:24:21 1999 Rex Feany <laeos@ptw.com>

	* Branched off the perl stuff in the CVS tree,
	  worry about it later
	* Changed ctl-e to default to END_OF_LINE.
	* added acconfig.h ... where did it go??
	* bumped up the version to 0.9e
	* removed the annoying dcc debug messages i left in 0.9d
	* fixed dcc, so that stuff from mirc/pirch have the linefeeds
	  removed (was broken before)

Fri Aug 06 12:59:04 1999 Rex Feany <laeos@ptw.com>

	* Added /orignick, should work like the bitchx version
	* added the beginings of a perl interpreter.

	  all the time.

	  happens to lusers that /ctcp {sound|trout} you (as long as you have ops 
	  in the chan;)

Sat Oct 17 00:12:42 1998 Rex Feany <laeos@ptw.com>

Thu Oct 15 18:34:33 1998 Rex Feany <laeos@ptw.com>

	* Incremented version (0.9c)
	* Changed a few bitchsay()s to yell()s (might we get rid of "bitchsay" 
	  altogehter?)
	* Fixed makefile to not say "configure your bot correctly" :) 
	  (this makefile was ripped from another one of my projects, Phosphene)

Wed Oct 14 17:25:12 1998 Rex Feany <laeos@ptw.com>

	* fixed the makefile to install the server and help
	  files

Wed Oct 14 15:42:29 1998 Rex Feany <laeos@ptw.com>

Wed Oct 07 20:06:58 1998 Rex Feany <laeos@ptw.com>

	* removed a lot of unused variables 

Wed Oct 07 19:42:40 1998 Rex Feany <laeos@ptw.com>

	* fixed -H command line argument.. should beable to specify
	  host on command line now
	* removed "bircrc_file" which was just the same as "ircrc_file" but
	  with a b. where is the logic in that? *shrug*

Wed Oct 07 19:10:28 1998 Rex Feany <laeos@ptw.com>

	* darn. Reverted fix for switch_channels, it only fixed it in 
	  a few cases, but broke it worse in others. old behavior is better!

Wed Oct 07 18:14:54 1998 Rex Feany <laeos@ptw.com>

	* Fixed switch_channels so it wouldnt switch from/to a channel
	  that is bound in a window.

Tue Oct 06 17:37:53 1998 Rex Feany <laeos@ptw.com>

	* Re-indented the source with 'indent -gnu -i8 -bli0' -- much better.

Sun Oct 04 22:35:58 1998 Rex Feany <laeos@ptw.com>

Sun Oct 04 21:31:14 1998 Rex Feany <laeos@ptw.com>

	* Fixed a problem which would cause Xaric to consume ~96% CPU
	  during a DCC chat.

Sun Oct 04 19:55:01 1998 Rex Feany <laeos@ptw.com>

	* /wallops now instead of warning about not being an oper, 
	  refuses to do anything if you are not an oper.

Sun Oct 04 19:31:28 1998 Rex Feany <laeos@ptw.com>

	* fixed (worked around?) an obscure bug with the whois code.
	  If a NICK command returns ERR_NICKNAMEINUSE, it automaticly
	  did a whois on the nick. Problem is, if it is the first NICK 
	  (initiating connection), we can't do a whois because we're not
	  connected. This confused the whois code, because we never got
	  a reply, and so it stayed in the whois queue, breaking anything
	  after that that used whois. FIX: if we arn't regisgered yet, don't
	  send a whois out.

Sat Oct 03 17:15:58 1998 Rex Feany <laeos@ptw.com>

	* got rid of do_newuser in source/misc.c

Sat Oct 03 14:43:32 1998 Rex Feany <laeos@ptw.com>

	* Name change! Now we are called Xaric.
	  Reason: I like unique names, and Karma was taken by a library,
	  written by Richard Gooch.
	* Start moving commands over to the tree instead of the 
	  linked list.

Sun Sep 13 03:23:10 1998 Rex Feany <laeos@ptw.com>

	* v0.8a released to the world

Mon May 11:53:02 1998 Rex Feany <laeos@ptw.com>

	* Fixed the default LEAVE format so now /part messages work;)
	  (try it.. /part #foo this place sucks:)
	* If you ever /join'ed a channel in one window and had another window open
	  and tried /part in the empty window it would crash. All fixed.

Tue Apr 15:59:25 1998 Rex Feany <laeos@ptw.com>

	Applied the first patch from Tyler, fixing up the 
	help files

Fri Mar 13 21:30 1998 Laeos

	* Fixed the 'ban' problem
	* Took out wsets, fixed a bug in teh status bar code
	  that would drop the last character of the status_format
	* Fixed a bug in the which_channel function and p_quit and

	* Fixed a bug in the kickban function that would cause
	  a core dump when you kicked someone not in the channel

Mon Nov 13 22:27 1997 Laeos

	* Fixed several things that got broke after removing
	  the WHO on channel join, most notably it will use
	  your reason when you kickban someone.
	* Removed /fuck command, it is the same as kickban since
	  I removed the internal shitlist.
	* Removed /fuckem command, basicly it would create 26 bans 
	  like *!*@*a* etc etc.
	* Hacked in pthread support.. right now, if you have pthreads
	  installed, when ever you use the /nslookup or /dns command
	  it will create a new thread to do the actual dns query.
	* Cleaned up the header files and prototypes a bit.. things were
	  really inconsistant.

	* Fixed /about command
	* Some other small changes
