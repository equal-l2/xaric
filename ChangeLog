	* xscandir.c - fix scandir() brokenness, just cast dselect to void so
	  that it will work no matter if scandir expects const or non-const 
	* ircaux.[ch] - remove vsnprintf/snprintf - configure.ac wasn't even checking for
	  them and the overrides were silly and broken.
	* merged some freebsd ports patches
	* autogen.sh from debian autotools, preping for building debian package
