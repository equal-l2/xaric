	* /topic * now does the expected thing. same for /untopic *

2006-12-19  Rex Feany  <laeos@laeos.net>

	* server.c:read_data() - so broken. when select timed out in the
	  middle of a line the line would be corrupted. Don't do that.
	* ncommand.c - fix /names * to replace * with current channel.
	  /names also uses current channel.
	* fix dcc - its not perfect, but it works (let me know if there are
	  problems!)
	* don't beep on privmsg by default (/set beep_on_msg)

2006-12-17  Rex Feany  <laeos@laeos.net>

	* xscandir.c - fix scandir() brokenness, just cast dselect to void so
	  that it will work no matter if scandir expects const or non-const 
	* ircaux.[ch] - remove vsnprintf/snprintf - configure.ac wasn't even checking for
	  them and the overrides were silly and broken.
	* merged some freebsd ports patches
	* autogen.sh from debian autotools, preping for building debian package
