                      Xaric Installation Readme File


Xaric is known to compile on the following systems (maybe others as well):
    * Linux


Introduction
------------

	Problems may occur in the compilation process of Xaric. If you
do have a problem please gather as much information about the error 
(output from make) and join the Xaric support channel on UnderNet, #foo,
or mail laeos@ptw.com Bug reports can be sent in exactly the
same way as well.

	Patches to make Xaric compile on other machines are most certainly
welcome, as are success stories. Currently I only have access to linux boxen,
so I can not be sure it will compile on anything else. 

	Xaric is based on BitchX code, which is itself based on ircII. The goal
of the Xaric writers is to clean out all the silly features, and fix all the
annoying little problems. BitchX is a large client. Many of the features such as
the userlists were removed because none of use ever used them. If you want your 
irc client to do *everything* Xaric is not for you. 

Compiling Xaric
---------------

In order to compile this distribution you need to do the following:
(Optional steps are marked with an asterisk, '*')

  1) Enter the xaric directory tree, this is the most important step.
     Executing configure outside the tree will incur problems.

  2) Run the GNU configuration script, ./configure. It should find
     whatever it needs for the compilation of xaric, such as system
     includes and locations of important files.
      
* 3) On some systems you may need to edit Makefile and enforce changes if
     compiling causes a problem. For instance, SystemV compliant boxes may
     require the crypt() library (libcrypt.a) for a routine in alias.c, 
     which produces a crypt-style password. Find the LIBS line, and 
     change it to (without the quotes): "LIBS= -lcrypt". Also see Machine
     Specific Instructions below.

* 4) include/config.h may need tweeking if you intend to change the
     default server. To change, locate DEFAULT_SERVER and remove the
     original default servers and add as many as you please (These will
     be appended to the /usr/local/share/xaric/irc.servers and ~/.ircservers
     list). 

  5) Execute 'make' inside the xaric archive directory. If no error
     messages are shown (error not warning messages) see below in this
     file for Machine Specific Instrctions on how to resolve common
     problems which users face when compiling.

  6) Execute 'make install'. This should install the xaric binary to
     /usr/local/bin. Commonly, users may not have superuser access, thus a
     refusal (permission denied message) will occur. If you insist to use
     'make install' to install xaric binary, it is required to change the
     installation path defined in step 4.

   7) Xaric comes with no scripts right now. In the spirit of BitchX, I want
      the most commen features people use scripts for to be compiled in.  
     

Machine Specific Instructions:

	On some SunOS 4.1.4 systems, strtoul (an ANSI C function) is not
properly detected as being missing. Editing include/defs.h by hand. This
file is automatically created by configure each time configure is run so
if you re-run configure you must edit include/defs.h again.

Offending error:
ld: Undefined symbol
    _strtoul
    _globfree
    _glob

Solution:
 edit include/config.h
 remove /* */ from the #define NEED_GLOB
 edit include/defs.h
 add #define NEED_STRTOUL

	Linux kernel version 1.3.80 made changes to the system include
files. A small definition was removed which will cause a lot of screen
orientated programs to fail on compiling. Both ircii-2.8 and BitchX
will fail when compiling on the file alias.c with an error message about
speed_t or ospeed being undefined. Instead of hacking around this
behaviour within BitchX, edit include/defs.h and supply at the start 
of the file either one of the following for the offending error:

Solution: (ospeed)
add "extern short ospeed;"

Solution: (speed_t)
add "#define speed_t unsigned short"
