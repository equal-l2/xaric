Introduction
------------

	Xaric is an irc client very similar to ircII, BotchX, or ircII EPIC.
	There are some pretty major differences though, such as the lack of 
	scripting, and color support.

Supported Architectures
-----------------------

	I have successfully compiled xaric 0.10.0 on the following:

		Linux/glibc2
		OpenBSD 2.5
		OpenBSD 2.6 
		BSDI 3.1

New Versions
------------

	New versions can always be found at <ftp://ftp.xaric.org/pub/xaric> 
	or <http://www.laeos.net/projects/xaric/>.

Bug Reports
-----------

	Like any other piece of software, xaric is not perfect. If you 
	encounter a bug, I am very interested in squashing it. Please
	send me the details via email to <laeos@laeos.net>.
